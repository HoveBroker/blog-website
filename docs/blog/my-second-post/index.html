  <p>At 19.00 hours, ship’s time, I made my way to the launch-
ing bay. The men around the shaft stood aside to let me
pass, and I climbed down into the capsule.
Inside the narrow cockpit, there was scarcely room to
move. I attached the hose to the valve on my space suit
and it inflated rapidly. From then on, I was incapable of
making the smallest movement. There I stood, or rather
hung suspended, enveloped in my pneumatic suit and
yoke to the metal hull.
I looked up; through the transparent canopy I could see
a smooth, polished wall and, far above, Moddard’s head
leaning over the top of the shaft. He vanished, and sud-
denly I was plunged in darkness: the heavy protective
cone had been lowered into place. Eight times I heard the
hum of the electric motors which turned the screws, fol-
lowed by the hiss of the shock-absorbers. As my eyes grew
accustomed to the dark, I could see the luminous circle of
the solitary dial.
A voice echoed in my headphones:
“Ready Kelvin?”
“Ready, Moddard,” I answered.
“Don’t worry about a thing. The Station will pick you
up in flight. Have a good trip!”
There was a grinding noise and the capsule swayed. My
1</p>
<p>muscles tensed in spite of myself, but there was no further
noise or movement.</p>
<p>“When is lift-off?” As I asked, I noticed a rustling out-
side, like a shower of fine sand.
“You’re on your way, Kelvin. Good luck!” Moddard’s
voice sounded as close as before.</p>
<p>A wide slit opened at eye-level, and I could see the stars.
The Prometheus was orbiting in the region of Alpha in
Aquarius and I tried in vain to orient myself; a glittering
dust filled my porthole. I could not recognize a single
constellation; in this region of the galaxy the sky was un-
familiar to me. I waited for the moment when I would pass
near the first distinct star, but I was unable to isolate any
one of them. Their brightness was fading; they receded,
merging into a vague, purplish glimmer, the sole indica-
tion of the distance I had already travelled. My body rigid,
sealed in its pneumatic envelope, I was knifing through
space with the impression of standing still in the void, my
only distraction the steadily mounting heat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a shrill, grating sound, like a steel
blade being drawn across a sheet of wet glass. This was
it, the descent. If I had not seen the figures racing across
the dial, I would not have noticed the change in direction.
The stars having vanished long since, my gaze was swal-
lowed up on the pale reddish glow of infinity. I could hear
my heart thudding heavily. I could feel the coolness from
the air-conditioning on my neck, although my face
seemed to be on fire. I regretted not having caught a
glimpse of the Prometheus, but the ship must have been out
of sight by the time the automatic controls had raised the
shutter of my porthole.
The capsule was shaken by a sudden jolt, then another.
The whole vehicle began to vibrate. Filtered through the
insulating layers of the outer skins, penetrating my pneu-
matic cocoon, the vibration reached me, and ran through
my entire body. The image of the dial shivered and multi-
plied, and its phosphorescence spread out in all direc-
tions. I felt no fear. I had not undertaken this long voyage
only to overshoot my target!
I called into the microphone:</p>
